## 1. Path-following sends unbounded intent vectors
- **File(s)**: `server/player_path.go`, `server/world_mutators.go`
- **Code**: `World.followPlayerPath` calls `w.SetIntent(player.ID, dx, dy)`.
- **Why it’s a problem**: The path-following code feeds the raw distance from the player to the next waypoint into `World.SetIntent`. `SetIntent` records a `PlayerIntentPayload` patch using those values, so any long-distance waypoint yields intents far outside the normalized `[-1, 1]` range produced by player input. Consumers that rely on patches (replay tools, client diagnostics) will see misleading movement vectors, making it look like players are moving faster than possible and breaking logic that assumes normalized intents.

## 2. Inventory comparison ignores fungibility keys
- **File(s)**: `server/world_mutators.go`
- **Code**: `inventoriesEqual` only checks slot index, item type, and quantity.
- **Why it’s a problem**: `Inventory` slots carry a `FungibilityKey` so stacks representing different rolls (e.g. unique items, bound gear) stay separate. Because `inventoriesEqual` ignores the key, mutations that only adjust fungibility (such as granting a unique copy or rekeying migrated items) are treated as no-ops, so no patch is emitted. Downstream clients and replays would miss the change and display the wrong item identity.

## 3. Patch inspector drops inventory fungibility metadata
- **File(s)**: `client/patches.js`
- **Code**: `cloneInventorySlots` rebuilds each slot with only `type` and `quantity`.
- **Why it’s a problem**: The client’s patch-tracing helpers strip the `fungibility_key` field from inventory payloads. Any tooling built on this module (patch history panels, replay sanity checks) can no longer tell whether stacks are meant to be merged or kept distinct, so unique/bound items appear identical to generic ones. That masks server bugs and makes it impossible to validate inventory diffs accurately.

## 4. Ground item normalization hardcodes type metadata
- **File(s)**: `client/network.js`
- **Code**: `normalizeGroundItems` defaults `type` to `"gold"` and omits `fungibility_key` entirely.
- **Why it’s a problem**: When the server introduces new ground item types or relies on fungibility keys (e.g. quest drops, personalised loot), the client’s normalization code silently rewrites them to plain gold piles. Any downstream UI or automation that trusts this structure will render the wrong item and can’t differentiate distinct stacks, leading to bogus pickups or testing blind spots.
