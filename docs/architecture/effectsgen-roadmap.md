# Effect Contract Generation Roadmap

This document tracks the engineering work required to deliver the `effectsgen` toolchain and its supporting data sources defined in [`effectsgen-spec.md`](./effectsgen-spec.md). It is the single source of truth for status and the next concrete tasks.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Goal                                     | Exit Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                               | Status         |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1     | Finalise Go contract registry            | Central Go package owns all effect contracts and validation helpers; unit coverage in place.                                                                                                                | ðŸŸ¢ Done        |
| 2     | JSON schema & catalog resolver           | JSON schema validated; loader in `server/effects` resolves designer `entryId` â†’ contract and caches lookups.                                                                                                | ðŸŸ¢ Done        |
| 3     | `tools/effectgen` TypeScript emitter     | Deterministic TS output for payloads/enums/catalog metadata with golden-file tests; generator wired to CI drift checks.                                                                                     | ðŸŸ¢ Done        |
| 4     | Client integration of generated bindings | Client imports generated module; WebSocket lifecycle batches hydrate `ContractLifecycleStore`; renderer draws from store snapshots using generated catalog metadata; CI enforces regeneration drift checks. | ðŸŸ¡ In progress |

## Active Work

### In progress

* ðŸŸ¢ **Consume generated catalog metadata on the client**
  Client modules now import canonical catalog data from `client/generated/effect-contracts.ts`; join-time payloads are verified against the generated snapshot and all downstream helpers read from the shared store.
* ðŸŸ¢ **Feed renderer from `ContractLifecycleStore`**
  Orchestrator now ingests WebSocket `state` batches into `ContractLifecycleStore` and emits render batches derived from generated catalog metadata/layers.
* ðŸŸ¢ **Lifecycle renderer smoke tests**
  Headless harness replays recorded lifecycle batches and asserts renderer output derives from generated catalog metadata and managed ownership flags.
* ðŸŸ¢ **effectsgen Go toolchain compatibility**
  Upgraded `golang.org/x/tools` (and indirect deps) so the generator builds cleanly with Go 1.24.3, restoring `npm run build` and client bundle output.
* ðŸŸ¢ **Lifecycle smoke coverage for client-managed entries**
  Extended `client/__tests__/lifecycle-render-smoke.test.ts` to replay a `managedByClient` catalog entry and assert renderer metadata retains ownership after lifecycle end.
* ðŸŸ¢ **Resync clearing coverage in renderer harness**
  Added a resync replay to `client/__tests__/lifecycle-render-smoke.test.ts` that asserts the lifecycle store clears retained entries and the renderer emits an empty frame when `payload.resync = true`.
* ðŸŸ¢ **Shared harness helper reuse**
  Extracted reusable headless orchestrator helpers in `client/__tests__/helpers/headless-harness.ts` so both server- and client-managed smoke coverage share the same catalog-driven setup.

* ðŸŸ¢ **Snapshot and tooling updates for client-managed flows**
  Surfaced `managedByClient` from `server/effect_catalog_metadata.go` and snapshot utilities so join payloads match the generated catalog bindings without manual overrides.

* ðŸŸ¢ **Resync catalog snapshots mirror server metadata**
  `server/hub.go` now attaches `snapshotEffectCatalog` output to resync/keyframe configs and the client orchestrator reuses the network payload; smoke coverage asserts the renderer hydrates with the server-sent snapshot.

* ðŸŸ¢ **Keyframe catalog hydration**
  `hub.HandleKeyframeRequest` now returns `snapshotEffectCatalog` payloads and the client orchestrator normalizes catalog snapshots from WebSocket keyframe replies with headless harness coverage.

* ðŸŸ¢ **Keyframe NACK resync fallback**
  `server/hub.go` and `server/messages.go` attach `snapshotEffectCatalog` metadata to `keyframeNack` responses, schedule the next broadcast as a resync, and `client/client-manager.ts` resets the lifecycle store on NACK before rehydrating from the resync payload with smoke coverage in `client/__tests__/lifecycle-render-smoke.test.ts`.

### Planned (to finish Phase 4)


## Definition of Done (Phase 4)

Phase 4 is complete when all of the following hold:

1. **Type authority**: All client type narrowing and catalog metadata originate from generated code in `client/generated/*`; no manual mirrors.
2. **Networkâ†’Store**: WebSocket lifecycle batches are parsed and inserted into `ContractLifecycleStore` with correct cursor semantics and resync handling.
3. **Storeâ†’Renderer**: The renderer pulls only from `ContractLifecycleStore` snapshots and generated catalog metadata for scheduling/ownership; no legacy paths.
4. **CI gates**:

   * Generator drift check fails CI if bindings are stale.
   * Golden tests for generated TS pass.
   * JSON schema validation passes for all catalogs.
   * A headless render smoke test asserts that at least one lifecycle-driven frame is produced for a known `entryId`.

## Reference Map (authoritative paths)

* **Contracts & schema**: `server/effects/contract`, `docs/contracts/effects.schema.json`
* **Catalog**: `server/effects/catalog` (loader/validation), `config/effects/definitions.json`
* **Generator**: `tools/effectsgen` â†’ `client/generated/effect-contracts.ts` (payloads, enums, catalog metadata)
* **Client runtime**:

  * Store: `client/effect-lifecycle-store.ts`
  * Orchestrator: `client/client-manager.ts` (hydrates store from network)
  * Network plumbing: `client/network.ts`, `client/main.ts`
  * Rendering: `client/render.ts` (reads store snapshots & catalog metadata)

## Suggested Next Task

**Implement client keyframe retry scheduling after resync fallback.**

**Acceptance criteria**

* `client/client-manager.ts` schedules a keyframe re-request when a `keyframeNack` is received and defers the retry until the resync payload has been applied.
* Retries respect the server's keyframe rate limiter (no more than one outstanding request) with configuration surfaced for throttling/backoff.
* Harness coverage in `client/__tests__/helpers/headless-harness.ts` + `client/__tests__/lifecycle-render-smoke.test.ts` asserts that the orchestrator issues a single retry, hydrates from the follow-up keyframe, and resumes rendering without duplicating lifecycle events.
