# Documentation Standards

* The docs are probably outdated, dont trust them. You don't need to keep them updated unless instructed by user.

These instructions cover every file beneath `docs/`.

- Prefer task-focused sections over narrative history. Each page should answer "what does a contributor need to know right now?"
- Use descriptive headings, ordered lists for processes, and tables for capability matrices when appropriate.
- Call out version requirements (Go, Node, npm) when they differ from defaults in the root README.
- Link to source files or configs using relative paths so future readers can navigate quickly.
