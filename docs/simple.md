# S.I.M.P.L.E. â€” Systematic Improvement & Maintenance for Project Logic Efficiency

This document tracks the ongoing effort to simplify and stabilize the codebase by removing duplication, reducing unnecessary checks, and consolidating systems into clear, maintainable flows. Developers can continue the work by reviewing the roadmap and active work tables below â€” no other documents are needed.

## Program Goals

* Each domain (effects, inventory, pathing, etc.) has exactly one mutation entry point.
* No duplicated logic between systems or between client and server.
* Patches and keyframes follow one consistent schema.
* Logs and debug checks exist only where they serve a real diagnostic purpose.
* Prefer deterministic data-driven behavior over flag-driven branches.
* Simplification work should reduce total code volume without altering semantics.
